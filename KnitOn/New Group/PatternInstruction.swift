//  The PatternInstruction class holds information for a specific knitting instructions and its
//  optional sub instructions. This class currently has a single property:
//      instructions -- must be assessed using a get
//
//  I envision this object gaining additional properties as we flesh out the UI, etc. For example
//  it might include a type, such as header or text. An instruction might also be tagged as an
//  "action". Or perhaps an instruction might have additional resources such as a link to an
//  online video or resource page.
